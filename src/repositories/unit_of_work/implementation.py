class UnitOfWork(AbstractUnitOfWork):
    """
    This class manages a transactional unit of work within a database session.

    Fields:
    `session` is an instance of `AsyncSession` that manages the database transaction.
                        This session is used to interact with the database within the transaction
                        boundary. It is required to begin, commit, rollback, and close the session.

    `_should_commit` flag controls whether or not changes in the transaction
    are committed to the database. By default, it is set to `True`, meaning that
    commit operations are allowed. If the flag is set to `False` using the
    `prevent_commit` method, the commit operation will be skipped when the
    `commit()` method is called, allowing for more flexibility in certain scenarios.

    Why Itâ€™s Useful:
    - This approach is helpful when you need to perform multiple database operations as part of a
      transaction, but you want to delay the commit until certain conditions are met, or if an
      operation fails, so you can prevent the commit during error handling or conditional logic.
